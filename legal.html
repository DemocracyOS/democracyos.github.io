designed to give you as much control and ownership over what goes on your site
as possible and encourage you to express yourself freely. However, be
responsible in what you publish. In particular, make sure that none of the
prohibited items (things like spam, viruses, or serious threats of violence)
appear on your site or get linked to from your site.<br>(These Terms of Service are available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license,
which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own
use. It was created by our good friends of&nbsp;<a href="http://automattic.com">Automattic</a>).</p><h2>Terms of Service</h2><p>The following terms and conditions
govern all use of the DemocracyOS.com website and all content, services and
products available at or through the website. The Website is owned
and operated by The DemocracyOS Foundation, Inc. (“The DemocracyOS Foundation”).
The Website is offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all
of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules,
policies (including, without limitation, The DemocracyOS Foundation’s Privacy Policy)
and procedures that may be published from time to time on this Site by The
DemocracyOS Foundation (collectively, the “Agreement”).
Please read this Agreement carefully
before accessing or using the Website. By accessing or using any part of the
web site, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this
agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this
agreement, then you may not access the Website or use any services. If these
terms and conditions are considered an offer by The DemocracyOS Foundation,
acceptance is expressly limited to these terms.
The Website is not directed to children
younger than 13, and service on the Website is only offered to users 13 years
of age or older. If you are under 13 years old, please do not register to use
the Website. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal
information to the Website represents that they are 13 years of age or older.<br><br><strong>1. Your DemocracyOS.com Account and Site.</strong> If you create a voting platform on the Website,
you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and voting
platform, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the
account and any other actions taken in connection with the voting platform. You
must not describe or assign keywords to your voting platform in a misleading or
unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or
reputation of others, and The DemocracyOS Foundation may change or remove any
description or keyword that it considers inappropriate or unlawful, or
otherwise likely to cause The DemocracyOS Foundation liability. You must
immediately notify The DemocracyOS Foundation of any unauthorized uses of your voting
platform, your account or any other breaches of security. The DemocracyOS

distributing, and promoting your voting platform. This license allows The

distribute (but not publicly display) your content through their services.
You also give other DemocracyOS.com users
permission to share your Content on other DemocracyOS.com sites and add their
own Content to it (aka to revoting platform your Content), so long as they use
only a portion of your post and they give you credit as the original author by
linking back to your site (the Revoting platformging function on
DemocracyOS.com does this automatically!).

Foundation will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Website, but you
acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made
immediately unavailable.

representations or warranties, The DemocracyOS Foundation has the right (though

opinion, violates any The DemocracyOS Foundation policy or is in any way
